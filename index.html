            Why did I leave a cushy banking job to venture into the tech
            industry? Because being able to work on something that interests you
            from anywhere at any time is a special opportunity. For example,
            following a suggestion from his wife, Instagram co-founder Kevin
            Systrom

            Stories like those will always inspire me! The idea of being able to
            build something you see a need for -
            <em>or something just for fun</em> - is incredibly exciting.

          <p class="about-content">
            I focus on building simple yet elegant experiences and deeply enjoy
            the freedom that developing web apps provides. Having this knowledge
            allows me to pursue other passions of mine, like mountaineering. I
            am thrilled to be on this journey.
