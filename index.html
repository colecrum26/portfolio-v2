            Why did I leave a cushy banking job to venture into the tech
            industry? Because being able to work from anywhere at
            any time is a rare opportunity. For example, following a suggestion from his wife,
            Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom added filters to his product at a
            bed and breakfast in Mexico. Jordan Wardle built a viral game
            (everyone played Wordle at one point) because he knew his girlfriend
            enjoyed word games. Those stories will always inspire me! The idea
            of being able to build something you see a need for - or something
            just for fun - is incredibly exciting.
          </p>
          <p class="about-content">
            I greatly value the freedom that developing web apps provides.
            Having this knowledge allows me to pursue passions that I otherwise
            might not be able to. I am thrilled to be on this journey!
